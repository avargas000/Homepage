<p>Hello, my name is Ana Vargas. I am 24 year old student. I am currently an undergrad Biology student who is also learning the ropes of programming at Year up. I am now focusing on HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby on rails, Java, and some Python.
  I was born in 1994 I grew up in the Dominican Republic. I moved to New Jersey by the time I was 12 years old. I am an animal lover and a team player, I typically like to spend my weekends playing softball and polishing off my codes. Another one of my hobbies is traveling and experiencing different cultures. Some of my favorite places that I have visited are India, Nepal, and China </p>
<p>Apart from traveling, trying different types of foods is something that I love doing. During my journey in Asian and South Asia, I was introduced to different types of Chaat, my favorite being samosa chaat. which I fell in love with. I truly amazed by its burst of flavor and spices. In addition, I was also introduced to Western Chinese food and fell in love with during my stay in Xi'an, China.
